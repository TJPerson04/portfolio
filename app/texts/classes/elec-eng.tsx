        program. This meant that from Sophmore year to Senior year I took
        increasingly more classes learning about electronic engineering. These
        classes included both the academic side, learning about different
        components and how they work, along with a hands-on workshop, where we
        actually built different circuits on breadboards, and then soldering
        them onto actual PCB's.
