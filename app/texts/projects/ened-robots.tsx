        In my freshman year of college I took two general engineering classes:
        Engineer Design Thinking 1 & Engineer Design Thinking 2, shortened to
        ENED 1 & ENED 2. In these classes our big project was to work in groups
        to build a robot out of Legos, programmed using a{" "}

        </a>
        . These robots were meant to mimic real world scenarios, each designed
        to complete a series of tasks. The first robot was coded in LabView, but
        the source code for the second robot can be found on my{" "}

        Although I doubt I will be building robots with Legos much outside a
        learning environment, this experience taught me a lot about working in a
        group and separating the workload according to everyone's strengths.
        Especially since I was working in a group of other engineering
        disciplines, I became in charge of the software, but I still had to
        communicate with and have a say in every other part of the building
        process so that I could write better code.
