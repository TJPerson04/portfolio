        Over the summer of 2024 I worked as a web designer for{" "}
        <a className="link" href="https://www.lussocosmetics.com/">
          Lusso Cosmetics
        </a>
        , a local cosmetics company in my hometown. At the time I was much less
        experienced in React, so I designed the website using{" "}
        <a className="link" href="https://www.wix.com/">
          Wix
        </a>
        . Although I didn't learn much about web development, I did learn a lot
        about website UI/UX design and I gained some website experience.
