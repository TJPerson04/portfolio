        As a senior in high school I worked with{" "}

        </a>
        , a local makeup busniness in my hometown, to design and build a new
        machine for pressing powder. When I was brought in I was shown an old
        machine, and told about all the ways it didn't work and was annoying and
        clunky to use. Then, over the course of about a year, I designed a new
        version that significantly simplified the process.

        This was my first real experience building something for professional
        use. This experience really taught me a lot about working through the
        entire building cycle, from designing to building to troubleshooting,
        and although I think if I went back to this project I would be able to
        improve on a lot of the technical aspects, I think this project really
        taught me a lot.
