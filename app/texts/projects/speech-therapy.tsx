        Since August of 2024 I have been working under the supervision of{" "}
        <a className="link" href="https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/novakdn">
          Professor Vesna Novak
        </a>{" "}
        at the University of Cincinnati developing a website made to be used in
        conjunction with a speech therapist for voice training. You can find the
        website at{" "}
        <a className="link" href="https://ceas5.uc.edu/transvoice/">
          https://ceas5.uc.edu/transvoice/
        </a>
        . The intent of this website is to be a practicing tool that allows
        users to practice exercises and track their progress over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this projects I have acted as a full stack developer, working on
        every part of the website front-to-back, though I spent most of my time
        working on the frontend. Through this project I have learned how to
        utilize many new tools, including{" "}
        <a className="link" href="https://www.docker.com/">
          Docker
        </a>{" "}
        to easily separate the project into containers that can be built up and
        taken down with simple commands, and{" "}
        <a className="link" href="https://ant.design/">
          Ant Design
        </a>{" "}
        which I have also implemented into frontend of the website you are
        looking at right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of right now I am still a part of this project, and I hope to
        continue to make it better and better.
