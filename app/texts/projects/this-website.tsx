        I began making this website as a side project in the spring of 2025. I
        had some experience in web development and I thought "How can I show off
        the cool projects I've been a part of?" So I decided to put my
        experience to the test and create my own website from scratch.

        This website is continually in development. I will continue to add to it
        as my portfolio grows and I have more projects and classes under my
        belt. Also as my skills grow I plan on continuing to improve to overall
        look and feel of this website, which is something I think is very
        important when it comes to the user experience.
